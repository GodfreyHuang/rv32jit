# rv32jit

`rv32jit` is a modern C++-based RISC-V instruction set simulator with a JIT
assembler serving as an x86-64 binary translator.

Features
* Fast runtime for executing the RV32 ISA
* Built-in ELF loader
* Implementation of partial Linux system calls

## Build and Verify

Currently, only GNU/Linux is supported for building `rv32jit`.

`rv32jit` relies on specific third-party packages for full functionality.
Please install the following package in advance.
* clang version 15+, which can be downloaded from the [LLVM Page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
* `libelf-dev`

Build the simulator:
```shell
$ make
```

You might receive the message "Please run 'make' again."
If you do, simply follow the instruction and run `make` once more.

Download prebuilt RISC-V ELF files and run:
```shell
$ make check
```
